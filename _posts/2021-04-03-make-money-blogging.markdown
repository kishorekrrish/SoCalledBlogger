## How Can I Earn Money By Blogging?

Blogging can earn you money in n number of ways, below are some effective and well-known ways.

2. By Affiliate marketing

We are going to deep dive into each of the methods in further chapters, But for now, let's just have a sneak peek of what each method has to offer.

### `Method 1:` Earn Money By Showing Ads On Your Website

**Are you crazy!!** Who is going to display ads on my blog, you might think. But there are many services and companies that are ready to display ads on your blog and pay you. There are many Ad companies to name a few like `Google Adsense`, `Taboola`, `Propeller Ads`, `Media.net`, and many more.

### `Method 2:` Earn Money By Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is a huge topic by itself. Not going too deep I will give you an idea of what it is. In short affiliate marketing is, you marketing a product that you do not own and get a commission if that gets sold on your recommendation. Haha! if you did not understand here is a real-life example.

>**Example:**
In Amazon there are multiple products, you found one of the products useful and recommended the product to your friends and blog readers. If people you have recommended purchased that product then in return Amazon gives you a commission as you have helped them make a sale.

### `Method 3:` By Writing articles in Established Blogs

There are some well-established websites like Medium, HubPages, Fiverr, WordPress, and many more such websites that let you write articles and publish on their blog and pay you. This is one of the easy ways to get paid as you don't have to create a blog of your own.
The cons of this method are that you don't own the site, and you are at risk of getting your account suspended if you are not abiding by the guidelines set by the website.
